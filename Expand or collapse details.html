     			  <p>
     			  	Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.

     	    	<p>
     	    		Birds arose as warm-blooded, arboreal, flying creatures with forelimbs adapted for flight and hind limbs for perching. This basic plan has become so modified during the course of evolution that in some forms it is difficult to recognize.

     	    	<p>
     	    		The structures associated with flight, even if they are vestigial or specialized for terrestrial or aquatic locomotion, easily distinguish birds from other animals. Whereas various skeletal and internal features are diagnostic of birds, feathers are unique to and present on all birds. Also unique to birds is their sound-producing organ, the syrinx.
